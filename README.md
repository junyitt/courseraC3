#Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

##The script - "run_analysis.R"
The script was divided into 5 sections:

1) Downloading the data and reading the data. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Selecting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Replacing the activities ID using descriptive activity names.

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) Creating an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Finally, writing the tidy data set into tidy.txt

##CodeBook.md 
Describes the variables inside the tidy data set.

##tidy.txt
The final output obtained, i.e. the tidy data set.
